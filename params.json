It uses a MPU(9axis) to track the position of your head and sends it wireless over wifi to your computer. The device has to be mounted to your head, in best cases your headphones.\r\n**Im a hobbyist, always check for possible mistakes. Im not responsible if anything goes wrong.**\r\n---\r\n##Hardware\r\n* NodeMCU (developmentboard with ESP8266, which can be programmed per USB\r\n* MPU 9255 (9axis gyro) Be aware, there are also MPU9150 and MPUI 9250. I choose MPU925*5*\r\n* TP4056 (Lipo-charging circuit) \r\n* Lipo Baterie. I chose 100mA. I think 200 would be better\r\n* Switch\r\n\r\n###Wiring\r\nTest your circuit on a breadboard first!\r\n* NodeMCU D1 -> MPU9255 SCL\r\n* NodeMCU D2 -> MPU9255 SDA\r\n* NodeMCU 3.3V -> MPU9255 VCC\r\n* NodeMCU GND -> MPU9255 GND\r\nBe careful to wire the charging circuit the right way. Also  change the resistor of this charging service to fit your needs of your Lipo\r\n* NodeMCU GND -> TP4056 OUT-\r\n* NodeMCU Vin -> TP4056 OUT+\r\n * I attached a switch beween the above connection to switch the device on and off  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Software\r\n [Coming soon]\r\n  \r\n###Calibration\r\n [Coming soon]\r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n",
